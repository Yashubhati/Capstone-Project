# Capstone-Project
Carbon offsetting is an interesting approach towards solving the problem of global warming and climate change. My team took it as our capstone project to enhance our knowledge of time-series analysis. We used LSTM, ARIMA and SARIMA models to try to predict the issuances on a monthly basis. Though the data had a high variance and the VCM itself is pretty new and hence unpredictable we were able to achieve decent results at the end. The best part was the massive learning experience that we had with this project.
